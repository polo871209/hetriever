# Feature Specification: Hugo Documentation Retriever

**Feature Branch**: `001-hetriever-stands-for`  
**Created**: 2025-09-30  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "hetriever stands for hugo doc retriever, I want to get the github document from hugo site, clean the unused hugo sytax > embed > save to chromadb so my LLM will have the latest doc that it can retrieve. for example https://github.com/istio/istio.io, or the AI often use outdated content"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
An LLM user needs access to current documentation for Hugo-based project sites hosted on GitHub. Instead of relying on outdated training data, the user wants their LLM to retrieve fresh documentation that has been preprocessed to remove Hugo-specific markup and stored in a searchable vector database.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a GitHub repository URL for a Hugo documentation site, **When** the user requests documentation retrieval, **Then** the system fetches all documentation content from the repository
2. **Given** raw Hugo documentation files with frontmatter and shortcodes, **When** the system processes the content, **Then** Hugo-specific syntax is removed while preserving semantic documentation content
3. **Given** cleaned documentation text, **When** the system generates embeddings, **Then** content is chunked appropriately and vector embeddings are created
4. **Given** embedded documentation chunks, **When** the system stores the data, **Then** embeddings and metadata are persisted to the vector database
5. **Given** an LLM query about project documentation, **When** semantic search is performed, **Then** the most relevant current documentation sections are retrieved

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the GitHub repository is private or requires authentication?
- How does the system handle documentation updates (incremental vs full refresh)?
- What happens when Hugo syntax parsing fails for a document?
- How does the system handle very large documentation repositories?
- What happens when the vector database is unavailable?
- How are duplicate or near-duplicate documents handled?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST fetch documentation content from GitHub repositories containing Hugo-based documentation sites
- **FR-002**: System MUST identify and extract Hugo frontmatter metadata from documentation files
- **FR-003**: System MUST remove Hugo-specific syntax including shortcodes, template directives, and formatting tags while preserving content semantics
- **FR-004**: System MUST preserve document structure including headings, lists, code blocks, and links after Hugo syntax removal
- **FR-005**: System MUST split cleaned documentation into chunks based on semantic boundaries (headings, section breaks, topic transitions)
- **FR-006**: System MUST generate vector embeddings for each documentation chunk using the vector database's default embedding model
- **FR-007**: System MUST store embeddings along with source metadata in vector database
- **FR-008**: System MUST support querying stored documentation via semantic similarity search
- **FR-009**: System MUST track documentation source and update timestamps for freshness validation
- **FR-010**: System MUST support documentation repositories added as submodules in a local directory
- **FR-011**: Users MUST be able to update documentation by manually updating the submodule references
- **FR-012**: System MUST validate that fetched content is valid Markdown before processing
- **FR-013**: System MUST log all processing operations including fetch, clean, embed, and store stages
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle processing failures gracefully without corrupting existing database state
- **FR-015**: System MUST preserve code examples and command-line snippets exactly as written in source documentation

### Key Entities
- **Documentation Repository**: Represents a GitHub repository containing Hugo documentation; includes repository URL, branch/tag reference, last fetch timestamp, authentication credentials if needed
- **Documentation File**: Individual Markdown file from repository; includes file path, raw content, Hugo frontmatter metadata, last modified timestamp
- **Cleaned Document**: Processed documentation with Hugo syntax removed; includes original file reference, cleaned content, extracted metadata, processing timestamp
- **Documentation Chunk**: Segmented piece of cleaned documentation; includes parent document reference, chunk text, position within document, semantic context
- **Document Embedding**: Vector representation of documentation chunk; includes chunk reference, embedding vector, dimensionality, embedding model identifier
- **Retrieval Result**: Query response containing relevant documentation; includes matched chunks, similarity scores, source references, metadata
